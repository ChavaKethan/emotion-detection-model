# Emotion-Detection-Model
🧠 Emotion Detection Using Physiological Signals
This project focuses on detecting and classifying human emotional states (such as stress, calm, and amusement) using physiological signals. The goal is to explore the effectiveness of biomedical signals in recognizing emotions through machine learning techniques.

📊 Problem Statement
In real-world environments like healthcare and human-computer interaction, understanding emotions through physiological signals helps create adaptive, responsive systems. Traditional emotion recognition is subjective; this project uses sensor data to objectively classify emotional states.

🧪 Dataset Used
Dataset: [WESAD (Wearable Stress and Affect Detection)]

Collected using wearable sensors (e.g., chest straps and wristbands)

Contains multimodal signals:

Electrodermal Activity (EDA)

Electromyography (EMG)

Respiration (RESP)

Temperature (TEMP)

Accelerometer (ACC)

⚙️ Technologies & Tools
Language: Python (Google Colab)

Libraries:

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Model training and evaluation

ML Models: Random Forest, SVM, Hybrid Models

Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall

🚀 Key Features
Cleaned and preprocessed raw biosignal data
